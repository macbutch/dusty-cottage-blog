Day of Settlement!

Mark did the pre-settlement inspectionn while the kids played in Merimbula on the beach.

We started digging up old carpets - found they'd been laid on top of older linoleum. Old newspapers under lino - dating from 1939 including April 1, 1939. Exactly 80 years!

We found some unexpected loot in the cream room: old clothes and books etc. 

Mark setup Lizzie to climb a tree.
