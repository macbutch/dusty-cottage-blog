Day of Settlement!

Mark did the pre-settlement inspectionn while the kids played in Merimbula on the beach.

We brought down a bunch of kitchen stuff we'd got for free in Canberra (bench tops, appliances etc) and Frank helped us unload them.

We started digging up old carpets - found they'd been laid on top of older linoleum. Old newspapers under lino - dating from 1939 including April 1, 1939. Exactly 80 years!

Exploring the cream room we found some unexpected loot: old clothes and books etc. 

Mark setup Lizzie to climb a tree.
