title: Slaying the Carpet Monster
---

Mark drove down to meet Frank and Ian who were working on new pier (?) under the house. They brought concrete mix from Pambula (or Merimbula?) and dug a hole under the kids bedroom.

Mark brought down a few more pieces from Canberra (oven door, laundry sink etc) and worked on removing the remaining carpet from the living areas, finishing by smashing the oven door and cleaning up the broken glass.
