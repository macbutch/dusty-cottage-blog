title: Slaying the Carpet Monster
---

I drove down to meet Frank and Ian who were working on new pier (?) under the house. They brought concrete mix from Pambula (or Merimbula?) and dug a hole under the kids bedroom.

I brought down a few more bits from Canberra (oven door, laundry sink etc) and worked on removing the remaining carpet from the living areas, finishing by smashing the oven door and cleaning up the broken glass.

This thing was heavy and difficult to managed. It dropped an impressive amount of dirt and dust (and an old chop bone) on the way out. Pretty gross. Frank said that there were flies flocking to it outside.
