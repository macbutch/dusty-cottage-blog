title: Slaying the Carpet Monster
---

I drove down to meet Frank and Ian who were working on new pier (?) under the house. They brought concrete mix from Pambula (or Merimbula?) and dug a hole under the kids bedroom.

I brought down a few more bits from Canberra (oven door, laundry sink etc) and worked on removing the remaining carpet from the living areas, finishing by smashing the oven door and cleaning up the broken glass.

This thing was heavy and difficult to managed. It dropped an impressive amount of dirt and dust (and an old chop bone) on the way out. Pretty gross. Frank said that there were flies flocking to it outside.

I got things a bit tidier before I broke the oven (and wasted a bunch of time cleaning up broken glass). I got almost all the underlay up and most of the lino. The remaining lino is still glued down fairly well - might need a heat gun to sort it out.
